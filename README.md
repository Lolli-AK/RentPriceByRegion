# RentPriceByRegion
Analyzing how rent prices across varying regions of the United States have changed over the past twenty years.

This project was coded in R Studio with data from the Office of Policy Development and Research. Throughout the project statistical methods of analysis were used, such as correlation coefficient, T-test, and percent change. Graphs and other visual aids are dispersed throughout the project, with an analysis of what each visual represents, and the conclusion that can be drawn from that visual, as well as an overarching conclusion at the end of the project, on how rent prices across varying regions of the United States have changed over the past twenty years.
